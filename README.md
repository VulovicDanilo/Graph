# Graph
Pointer based implementation of graph in C++ without using STL.

Info parts of nodes are integers.

Finding, inserting and deleting both nodes and edges is working.
You can print nodes with their neighbours or adjacency matrix.

BFS and DFS traversals should be working.

Kruskal, Prim, Boruvka algorithm's will soon be implemented.
